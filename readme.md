Hi I am Rishav Shekhar and this is a small project I created using Node MCU Blynk Cloud and MQ2 Sensor.
The main purpose of this project is to sense the Smoke , LPG and Carbon Monoxide content of the air and alert the owner if the any of the values cross the threshold value ,
that is basically when there is a big due to gas leak.
This project was made under the guidance of my robotics club CORSIT./
